# DIM-SUM

You need to create a folder called "results" to run python scripts.
The C+- code was developed with Visual Studio 2015.
This code was developed by Ran Ben-Bassat, Gil Einziger, Roy Friedman and Yaron Kassner.
It is an extension of code by G. Cormode published here: http://hadjieleftheriou.com/frequent-items/index.html
Our extensions of Cormode's code are the python scripts for evaluation (python/*),
the implementation of the IMSum algorithm (src/alosum.*) and the implementation of the DIMSum algorithm (src/losum.*).
In addition, we have edited the hh.cc file to include evaluation for the added algorithms.

## Traces

All of the traces were available from [CAIDA](http://www.caida.org/data/), the center for applied internet data analysis.
